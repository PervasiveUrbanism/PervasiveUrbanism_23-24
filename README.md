# Skills Module Pervasive Urbanism 2023-24

**Online Archive for Skills Module RC15 2023/24**

This archive holds class materials from the **2023/24 Skills Module**. Since the module content is updated annually, some topics may no longer be taught but could still be relevant to your project. Keep in mind, though, that archived content is no longer currentâ€”the latest Skills Module takes precedence.

In general, you'll find materials covering the following software packages:

- QGIS
- VVVV
- Python
- Rhino and Grasshopper
- Arduino

Some folders may be empty due to storage limitations, but the associated code and definitions are still available. 

All classes were recorded and the playlist can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0TJgiFZ0aRLx7_uol3rhIsS53ecXHYlr).

## Modules
### Skills 01 - SENSING THE CITY
This module will serve as preparation for the participatory event in Hackney, where students will learn the skills to construct a datalogger, deploy it, and present the data visually. The datalogger will be programmed using Arduino and will function as a portable device capable of recording various aspects of the human body, such as skin humidity. Each recorded reading will be associated with a specific time and location, and the data will be stored in a text file. Subsequently, this text file will be visualized and analyzed immediately. To accomplish this, we will learn how to create location-based 3D visualizations using software like Rhino/Grasshopper and/or VVVV.

### Skills 02 - DATA MINING THE CITY
In contrast to the previous workshop, in this module we will teach desktop-based data mining techniques, with a particular emphasis on urban data. We will utilize a range of data mining and web scraping tools, focusing on publicly accessible data, web APIs, and data scraping methods for websites that lack alternative interfaces. Our primary area of interest will be data relevant to London, using sources like the London Datastore, social media platforms such as Flickr and YouTube, Google, Transport for London, and various websites like Timeout or TripAdvisor. During the workshop, we will explore text and image-based sentiment analysis, as well as machine learning methods for object recognition, image-based point cloud reconstruction and generative design. The results of these exercises will be visualized using VVVV, Python, and/or Grasshopper.

### Skills 03 - DATA DRIVEN GEOMETRIES
This module looks deeper into aspects of data visualization and techniques for generating data-driven geometries. Our primary emphasis will be on real-time GPU-based agent simulations, which allow for the dynamic rendering and simulation of large numbers of particles. We will explore strategies for modifying their behaviours and spatial trajectories. Moreover, we will learn the use of raymarching, signed distance fields, and point clouds to create non-standard geometries that can adapt to external parameters. All of these elements will be demonstrated in real-time within a virtual environment created using VVVV Fuse.

## Github
We will use this GitHub page for storing and distributing sample codes, links, recordings, and other materials related to the skills modules. Updates will be made to this page regularly throughout the year. You have the option to clone this repository to your computer and update it regularly. We will use a small portion of the total functionality and if you're unfamiliar with GitHub, it would be best to install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and to have a look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) for more information.
