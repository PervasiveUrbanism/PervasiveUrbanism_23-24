Great ambiance, located in one of the archway viaducts, with outdoor and indoor seating. The menu changes daily, and you\u2019re asked to take a picture at the door before you\u2019re seated. We sat at the bar in the back of the restaurant which was lovely. Ordered the side bread & butter, roasted leeks, steak tartar, and chicken rice. Everything was delicious, but we probably wouldn\u2019t order the steak tartar again.  The cocktails were light and paired well with the food, we each got the old friend and arch negroni.

The cocktails were well mixed with good amounts of alcohol. Plenty of wine to be had as well\n\nThe outdoor seating feels great, sadly, it was too cold to truly enjoy it when during my visit and the patio felt a bit closed off, which resulted in a more smokey atmosphere due to the proximity of the kitchen to the patio. It wasn't overbearing or unmanageable, in fact the smells were delicious. However, fresh air would have been preferred.\n\nI look forward to coming back during the warmer months.", "time": 1687001887, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Blake Cronyn", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103976262501546427886/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVnfw0RpTOrd5xKEts7Ouqnjh3yUAv-Zya7F4eIWW-5gdLq=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "This restaurant is so so good!
